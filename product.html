        A contract can be created by either the Lender or the Borrower using the Contract Manager service. However, it is expected that both parties access the platform, read the contract and sign it digitally before it becomes valid.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        One requirement for the Contract Manager though is that the borrowing party is expected to provide their BVN. This is proof that they accepted the conditions before proceeding. The information also helps us with recovery should they default on their payment commitments. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        To create a contract, one needs to simply open an account and follow the step by step instructions. It is usually best to agree on the terms with each party before beginning the process of registering the loan.

        This service is available to our Enterprise clients only. To access, you would need to create an enterprise account. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Once verified for this, there are several ways to use this service.  One is to manually upload or retrieve the data using the window available on the web platform. This requires little programming skills.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The other process involves automating the request using the application programming interface (API). With this,  you (Lenders) can, from the comfort of your lending software platform, share or retrieve the information you need to make proper credit decisions. This is much faster and efficient, but your technical team would need to do some software integrations.

        Once complete, users can access the Marketplace and review the hundreds of loans available. We generally advise that users  take time to compare as the conditions of each lender vary and it is possible to get more suitable offers down the list. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Once done, simply apply to the Lender on the link provided. On our part, we generally inform the Lenders about you, and support your applications.
